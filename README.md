# wa-robotics-scout-feedback-handler
Sends responses to the Send Feedback form in WARS Web to the WARS development board on Trello

A template for a feedback handler for Google Forms, so that form responses, not necessarily in their entirety, can be forwarded on to an agile board on Trello.

Sensitive or changing data, like the Trello label IDs and Trello API credentials are stored as script properties to keep them out of the source code and to make changing them easy.
